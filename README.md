# sup_lv_proj
This repository is intended again (as many other my repositories hosted here) for only keeping some demos of workflows / procedures centrally and under vcs.  
The code is "made" in the LabVIEW 2020, if someone will be interested in using it somehow.  
Demos have been made only for needs of some numerical calculations / some workflows testing and may be used in projects hosted somewhere else.
